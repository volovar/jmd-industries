We recorded user behaviors at the moment when they utilized curent market offerings. We confirmed our hypothesis that users are drawn to live sharing apps primarily due to the immediate feedback they receive. A notable drawback in the current market offering was what we termed 'social network fatigue,' caused by switching between different sharing apps. Over 80% of target users shared live once, while only 37% shared live twice, opting instead to record experiences in less ephemeral ways. Our second method involved interviews with the target user base. We obtained valuable insight into use-cases we had previously not considered, such as sharing live as a means of direct communication."
